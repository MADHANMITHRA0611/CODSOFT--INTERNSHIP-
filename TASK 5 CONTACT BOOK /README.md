# 📇 CONTACT BOOK – TASK 5 🔐  
### ✅ Completed as Part of CodSoft Python Development Internship

Welcome to my **Task 5 submission – Contact Book App** – a command-line application designed to help users manage their contacts easily and efficiently!

---

## 🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW

📖 The **Contact Book** application is a simple yet powerful Python-based tool that allows users to:

🔹 Store contact details  
🔹 Search contacts easily  
🔹 Update existing information  
🔹 Delete entries if no longer needed  
🔹 View all contacts in a clean format

💡 This project is ideal for learning how to manage structured data using lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions in Python.
