# 🔐✨ TASK 3 – ADVANCED PASSWORD GENERATOR  
> ✅ Internship Project | 💼 CodSoft | 🚀 Built with Python

---

## 🧠 ABOUT THE PROJECT

The **Advanced Password Generator** is a command-line Python application developed as part of my **CodSoft Internship (Task 3)**. Its purpose is to help users generate **highly secure and customizable passwords** for personal or professional use. With options to define length and complexity, this tool supports **safe digital habits** and **real-world security awareness**.

This project is designed not just to fulfill internship requirements—but also to demonstrate my understanding of:

- Secure coding practices 🛡️  
- Clean CLI application development 💬  
- Logical thinking with user interaction loops 🔁  
- Real-time validations ⚠️  
- Cryptographic randomness 🧬

## 📂 PROJECT STRUCTURE

```
📦 PasswordGenerator-Task3
 ┣ 📜 password_generator.py       ← Main source code
 ┗ 📄 README.md                   ← You’re reading this!
```

## 🔧 CODE ARCHITECTURE

### 🔹 Functional Breakdown

- `generate_password()` → Builds a secure password based on character set options  
- `evaluate_strength()` → Evaluates how strong the password is based on complexity  
- `get_boolean()` → Simplifies yes/no prompts from users  
- `main()` → Manages the overall program flow with validation and repeat support

### 🔹 Logical Flow

1. Prompt user for length and character types
2. Generate password using selected sets
3. Evaluate strength
4. Display output with user option to regenerate
