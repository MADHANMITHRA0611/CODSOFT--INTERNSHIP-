💻 CodSoft Internship Projects – Python Development

Welcome to my CodSoft Internship Projects Repository!
This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly Python projects that I completed as part of my internship at CodSoft. Each project focuses on core Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, file handling, randomization, and string manipulation. These tasks helped me improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills through real-world coding challenges.

🔖 Tasks Covered

✅ Task 1: To-Do List Application

This command-line based application allows users to manage and organize their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, view all tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks when needed. It can optionally save and load tasks from a file for future use.

✅ Task 2: Calculator

A simple yet effective calculator built using Python. It takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes error handling for invalid inputs or division by zero.

✅ Task 3: Password Generator

This script generates strong and secure random passwords. The user can specify the length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols. It utilizes Python’s random and string modules to ensure randomness and security.

✅ Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

An interactive terminal-based game where the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the game logic determines the winner. The game can track scores across multiple rounds and allows the user to replay.
